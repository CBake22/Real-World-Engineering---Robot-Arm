# Real-World-Engineering---Robot-Arm
  Welcome to the Real World Engineering Robotic Arm Team!
  General organization rules are as follows:
    1. Folders and subfolders will be used to organize different vode
      ex. Folder V2.1 will be included in V2
    2. General or base programs will be included in the "General" folder
      ex. An example 3 motor control program would be included here
      ex. A motor movement program specific to version V.3.1 would go in a version folder instead
    3. Keep code readable, include comments often
